                    I am a depth psychotherapist who utilizes a somatic and psychodynamic approach. Together with my clients we look at past and present identity formation, intimacy patterns, and protective behaviors. With nonjudgmental perspective exploration we engage the unconscious through creative invitation and the body, and we get curious about the personal metaphors living in and alongside them to help expand understanding around the rest of their stories. I often partner with people who are experiencing the confusion, anger, and/or shame that comes from living with persistent emotional hunger pangs. At the core of my work, I endeavor to facilitate the healing process between my clients and their deep desire for a well-fed life.

                    I work with individuals and couples and I have extensive experience supporting clients as they seek to reestablish personal agency and reconnect with their erotic intelligence. I aim to empower people by deepening their understanding of how the past may be affecting the present. I am passionate about shedding light on invisible and/or emotional labor within relationships and I offer support in the naming and navigation of physical, mental, and emotional symptoms born from ongoing relational imbalances. I believe in the integral, connective role of embodied androgyny in healthy relationships and I remain ever interested in how race and gender impacts privilege, diagnosis, social credibility, and cultural progress.
                </p>
                <p>
                    My work is trauma-informed and intersectional and I have experience working with relationship issues, depression, anxiety, grief & loss, Complex PTSD, parenting/co-parenting stressors, and life stage transitions. I hold a Master of Arts in Depth Psychology with an emphasis in Somatic Studies from Pacifica Graduate Institute (2014) and a Master of Science in Clinical Mental Health Counseling from The University of Nebraska at Omaha (2018.)

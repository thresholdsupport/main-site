                    I am a depth psychotherapist who utilizes a somatic and psychodynamic approach. I explore past and present identity formation, intimacy patterns, and the personal metaphors living alongside my clients to help them gain a better understanding around the rest of their stories. With nonjudgmental perspective exploration my clients and I engage the unconscious through creative invitation and the body. I often partner with people who are experiencing the confusion, anger, and/or shame that comes from living with persistent emotional hunger pangs. At the core of my work as a psychotherapist, I endeavor to facilitate the healing process between my clients and their deep desire for a well-fed life.

                    I support both individuals and couples in the naming and navigation of physical, mental, and emotional symptoms that come from ongoing or unconscious relational imbalances. I am passionate about shedding light on invisible labor within relationships that, when left unacknowledged, can lead to disconnection and burnout. I aim to empower my clients by facilitating a deepened understanding of how the past may be affecting the present. I believe in the integral, connective role of embodied androgyny in healthy relationships and I am ever interested in how race and gender impacts privilege, diagnosis, social credibility, and cultural progress.

                    I am a trauma-informed psychotherapist who utilizes a somatic and psychodynamic
                    approach. I explore past and present identity formation, intimacy patterns, and personal
                    metaphors to help my clients gain better understanding of the rest of their stories. With
                    nonjudgmental perspective exploration I engage the unconscious through creative invitation and
                    the body. I often partner with people who are experiencing the confusion and shame that
                    comes from living with persistent emotional hunger pangs. At the core of my therapeutic work,
                    I facilitate the healing process between my clients and their deep desire for a well-fed life.

                    As a certified <a href="https://www.fairplaylife.com" id="fpbold">Fair Play Method Facilitator</a> I support individuals in a myriad of relationship situations in the naming and
                    navigation of physical, mental, and emotional symptoms that come from persistent relational
                    imbalances. I am passionate about shedding light on invisible labor that, when left
                    unacknowledged, can lead to disconnection and burnout. I believe in the integral, connective role of
                    embodied androgyny in healthy relationships. By offering Fair Play as a lens, I aim to empower my clients by raising
                    awareness around how gender and race impacts privilege, diagnosis, social credibility, and
                    cultural progress.

                    Psychology with an emphasis in Somatic Studies from Pacifica Graduate Institute (2014) and a Master of
                    Science in Clinical Mental Health Counseling from The University of Nebraska at Omaha (2018.)
